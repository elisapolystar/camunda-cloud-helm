## Installing Charts

We recommend you to use Kubernetes when deploying Camunda 8 to production self-managed. For more
details, please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/kubernetes/)
in the official Camunda Platform documentation.

The charts can be accessed by adding the following Helm repo to your Helm setup:

```sh
helm repo add camunda https://helm.camunda.io
helm repo update
```

Then, you can install the Helm charts by running:

```sh
helm install <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> camunda/camunda-platform
```

### Local Kubernetes

We recommend to use Helm + KIND for local environments, as the Helm configurations are battle-tested
and much closer to production systems.

For more details:
[Installing the Camunda Helm chart locally using KIND](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/kubernetes-helm/#installing-the-camunda-helm-chart-locally-using-kind)

### OpenShift

See the [openshift](/openshift) sub-folder on how to get started with the charts on OpenShift. 

## Configure Charts

Helm charts can be configured via using extra values files or directly via the `--set` option. make sure to check out the [Camunda Platform Helm Charts Readme](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/charts/camunda-platform/README.md) for more information.

Example to enable the prometheus ServiceMonitor for Zeebe:

```sh
helm install <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> camunda/camunda-platform --set zeebe.prometheusServiceMonitor.enabled=true
```

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```sh
helm uninstall <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
```
> **Note**
>
> Notice that all the services and pods will be deleted, but not the Persistence Volume Claims which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch.

In order to free up the storage you need to manually delete all the Persistent Volume Claims. You can do this by running:

```sh
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
kubectl get pvc -l release=<YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```sh
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
kubectl delete pvc -l release=<YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
```

Or you can simply delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains the resources.

## Deprecation of zeebe charts

With the creation of the Camunda Platform Helm charts (previously known as ccsm-helm), the old zeebe-* charts have been deprecated.
This means they are no longer part of the repository and no longer maintained. The packaged charts are still available
for download.

The following charts are deprecated:

 * zeebe-full-helm
 * zeebe-cluster-helm
 * zeebe-operate-helm
 * zeebe-tasklist-helm

The new `camunda-platform` chart is a full replacement of `zeebe-full-helm` and replaces (contains) all other charts as sub-charts.
All sub-charts in `camunda-platform` are per default enabled.

For a complete migration guide see [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/blob/main/MIGRATION.md).
